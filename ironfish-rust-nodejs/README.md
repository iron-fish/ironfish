# ironfish-rust-nodejs

Wraps [ironfish-rust](../ironfish-rust/README.md) as a NodeJS native addon.

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

To learn more about Neon, see the [Neon documentation](https://neon-bindings.com).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

### `npm build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm build` and `npm build-*` commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm build-debug`

Alias for `npm build`.

#### `npm build-release`

Same as [`npm build`](#npm-build) but, builds the module with the [`release`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#release) profile. Release builds will compile slower, but run faster.
