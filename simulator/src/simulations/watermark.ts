 * Watermark simulation
 * - Run a few nodes, sending transactions between them and monitoring the memory usage over time
 * - whats the high watermark of the node (memory leak test)
 * - peak usage (record memory usage in intervals)
 * - can also set limit in test, if a node goes over it should print a failure
 * - then can investigate to find cause
 * - make graphs!!!
