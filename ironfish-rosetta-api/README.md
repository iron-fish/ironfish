# ironfish-rosetta-api

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/iron-fish/ironfish/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=PCSVEVEW5V&flag=ironfish-rosetta-api)](https://codecov.io/gh/iron-fish/ironfish)

API used for the Iron Fish Block Explorer.

The architecture is as follow

One instance:
Database <- Syncer -> Iron Fish node

Other instance
API -> Database

The block explorer client connects to the API. It allows scaling the API and the database, while still needing only one Iron Fish node and one Syncer.

## Installation

```sh
yarn
```

## Database

Depends on Postgres

```sh
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

createdb rosetta;

psql rosetta
CREATE USER postgres;
grant all privileges on database rosetta to postgres;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER to postgres;
```

### Run migration

```sh
# Create a migration
yarn run migrate create my migration
# Run the migration
yarn run migrate up
# Rollback
yarn run migrate down
```

## Documentation

Run dev environment and access `http://localhost:8000/docs/`

## Development

```
brew services start postgresql
yarn dev
```

## Production

Starting the API:

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

Starting the Syncer:

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn start:syncer
```

Start an Iron Fish node with

```sh
ironfish start --rpc.tcp --rpc.tcp.port=8021
```
