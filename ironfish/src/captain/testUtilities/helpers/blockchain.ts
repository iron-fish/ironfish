/**
 * Make a block with a hash consisting of the given digit,
 * the previous hash consisting of the next digit, and the start and
 * end numbers of a sequence of notes in the block.
 *
 * Note: The resulting block is suitable for use on a blockchain.BlockChain,
 * but will fail if you try adding it to an anchorchain without some extra
 * massaging of the values.
 *
 * Specifically, the nullifier commitment does not have a correct value against
 * the value in the tree. The note commitment should match up, though it depends
 * exactly how the tree was initially produced.
 *
 * Most notably, a block created with this function will not go onto a chain
 * created with makeChain or makeCaptain. You are probably better off using
 * makeNextBlock from the anchorChain test utilities instead.
