 * Expose a worker task that attempts to mine 1000 randomness
 * values.
 *
 * It hashes each value using the hashFunction and checks if
 * it meets the provided Target. If it does, that randomness
 * is return, otherwise it tries again.
 *
 * After 1000 numbers it exits, returning undefined
 *
 * @param headerBytesWithoutRandomness The bytes to be appended to randomness to generate a header
 * @param miningRequestId An identifier that is passed back to the miner when returning a
 *        successfully mined block
 * @param initialRandomness The first randomness value to attempt. Will try the next
 * 1000 randomness values after that
 * @param targetValue The target value that a valid block hash must be below for
 *        a given randomness
 * @param batchSize The number of attempts to mine that should be made in this batch
 *        each attempt increments the randomness starting from initialRandomness
 * @returns object with initialRandomness (useful as a promise identifier)
 *        and a randomness value that is either a successfully mined number or undefined,
 *        and the miningRequestId that was sent in
