# benchmarks

A collection of benchmarks and other related performance tests.

These are for development purposes only and do not get shipped with the Node. As such, changes in this package do not require a version bump for releases.

## Usage

`cargo benchmark -- simple` - run benchmarks with "simple" in the name.
